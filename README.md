# LIFX

My personal LIFX controller allows control of LIFX smart lights based on sunrise, sunset and other specified times.
The scripts retrieve the sunrise and sunset times for location using an API (latitude and longitude) and automatically adjust the color of LIFX lights.
Currently set up using my personal light IDs and scenes.
